Overview of the Project
In this project, I will design and implement a database to manage a library's book inventory, member information, and borrow/return transactions. 
The goal is to learn basic SQL commands and understand the principles of relational database design through a practical, hands-on approach.

To achieve this, I will create three primary tables:

Books: This table will store all relevant information about each book in the library, such as the title, author, genre, published year, and the number of available copies. 
This will help me keep track of the library's inventory.

Members: This table will contain personal details of library members, including their names, contact information, and the date they joined the library.
This will allow me to manage member information effectively.

Transactions: This table will record all borrow and return transactions, linking each member to the books they borrow, along with the dates these transactions occur.
This will enable me to monitor which books are currently checked out and which have been returned.
